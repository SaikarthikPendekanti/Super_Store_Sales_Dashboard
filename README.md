This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze Super Store sales performance.
The goal is to transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights by examining:

Sales trends

Profitability

Product performance

Regional and customer analytics

Operational metrics like shipping and order behavior

The dashboard is designed to help business users make informed decisions, identify growth opportunities, and detect problem areas like low-profit product categories or poor-performing regions.
The dataset contains 5,901 rows and 23 columns with detailed sales information from the Super Store, including order dates, shipping details, customer names, segments, and geographic fields such as city, state, and region. It also includes product-related data like category, sub-category, and product name, along with key sales metrics such as sales amount, quantity, profit, returns, and payment mode. This combination of order, customer, location, and product fields provides a complete view of sales performance suitable for creating a Power BI analytics dashboard.
The Super Store Sales Dashboard is a complete business intelligence solution offering deep insights into sales performance, customer trends, and product profitability.
This project demonstrates competence in:

Data modeling
